TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.128 ns between a0/afu0/f0/c0/cu0/rs_reg[basepair][4]/C (clocked by userclk2_1) and a0/afu0/f0/c0/cu0/rs_reg[cell][0]/D (clocked by userclk2_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
